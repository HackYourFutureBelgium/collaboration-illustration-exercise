# Collaboration Illustration Exercise

Here is an exercise to illustrate how collaboration could be painful and chaotic.

- Coach have to prepare a public google sheet document (Example [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k3HAQohWrRWvofghbBkZ1LLACyh-mizV0urjVM9rvO8/edit?usp=sharing))
- Ask every student to go on it and make following steps. Wait the go of the coach to do the next step.

Each student should:
- Step 1: Add your First and Last name (e.g. `John Doe`)
- Step 2: Choose randomly a teammate name and put it into a color
- Step 3: Choose another name (not the same that you choose previously) and add a nickname after the name (e.g. `John Doe` will became `John Doe aka The Joker`)
